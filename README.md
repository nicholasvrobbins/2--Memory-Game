Following along with Ania on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk&t=3880s) learning how to build apps with JavaScript. I've been learning many of these principles and ideas in FCC and many of them look familiar such as the for loop, creating functions, if statements, and being able to use them in practice to build something is incredibly helpful for understanding it deeper. This was my first REAL JavaScript project where I went in depth and really built something pretty cool!
